  <p>Terms of Use</p>
  <p>Get familiar with the policies, terms, and conditions for the use of TRUSTEPPY.

<p>Summary</p>
TRUSTEPPY help blind and visually impaired people to recognize obstacles and avoiding them.

These are the terms that explain how you can use our services, and they form a legal agreement between you and us. This section summarizes the terms, but you need to read through the entire document. This is a legal agreement, so please read it carefully.

By accessing or using “TRUSTEPPY” (the App), you agree to be bound by these terms of use ("Terms of Use"). The App is owned or controlled by Francesco Maria Di Donna (“we”, “us”, “our”). These Terms of Use affect your legal rights and obligations. If you do not agree to be bound by all of these Terms of Use, do not access or use the App.
<p>
1.	Under the age of 18, you must have parental consent to use the App. Other than as expressly set out in these terms we don’t make any commitments about the content within the App, the specific function of the App, or its reliability, availability, or ability to meet your needs.
</p>
</p>
2.	We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to change these Terms of Use ("Updated Terms") from time to time. You agree that we may notify you of the Updated Terms by posting them on the App, and that your use of the App after the effective date of the Updated Terms (or engaging in such other conduct as we may reasonably specify) constitutes your agreement to the Updated Terms. Therefore, you should review these Terms of Use and any Updated Terms before using the App. The Updated Terms will be effective as of the time of posting, or such later date as may be specified in the Updated Terms and will apply to your use of the App from that point forward. These Terms of Use will govern any disputes arising before the effective date of the Updated Terms.
</p>
<p>
3.	You are solely responsible for your interaction with the App. Exercise common sense and your best judgment when interacting with the App.
</p>
<p>
4.	You agree that there is no legal or contractual relationship or obligation between you and the TRUSTEPPY for whatever reason by using the App.

Rights
</p>
<p>
The App name and logo are trademarks of TRUSTEPPY, and may not be copied, imitated or used, in whole or in part, without our prior written permissio.

Although it is our intention for the App to be available as much as possible, there will be occasions when the App may be interrupted, including, without limitation, for scheduled maintenance or upgrades, for emergency repairs, or due to failure of telecommunications links and/or equipment.

Disclaimer of Warranties
We don't warrant that the App will be error-free or uninterrupted; that defect will be corrected; or that the App or the server that makes the App available is free from any harmful components, including, without limitation, viruses. The App is provided “as is,” as available, and without any warranties or conditions. You agree not to rely on the services, or any information in the services, or their continuation. We disclaim all and make no representations or warranties, of any kind, either express or implied, as to the quality, identity or reliability of the app, or as to the accuracy, completeness or usefulness of any function of the App. You acknowledge that your use of the App is at your sole risk.

Not an Emergency System
TRUSTEPPY is not designed to be or intended for use as an emergency aid, a means of obtaining or delivering emergency services, or a means for delivering or receiving medical treatment or medical or health services. The App has not been tested or approved for such critical, high-risk uses and you agree that you will not use the App for such purposes.

Release
You hereby release us (and our affiliates, officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, joint ventures and employees) from claims, demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with a dispute between you and any third party, including without limitation another user of our App, whether it be at law or in equity.

Informal Dispute Resolution (?)

Indemnification
You (and also any third party for whom you operate an account or activity on the App) agree to indemnify and hold us harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including without limitation, reasonable attorney's fees and costs, arising out of or in any way connected with any of the following (including as a result of your direct activities on the App or those conducted on your behalf):
-	your breach or alleged breach of these Terms of Use;
-	your violation of any laws, rules, regulations, codes, statutes, ordinances or orders of any governmental and quasi-governmental authorities, including, without limitation, all regulatory, administrative and legislative authorities; or any misrepresentation made by you. You will cooperate as fully required by us in the defense of any claim.

Governing Law & Venue
You are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws where you live or access the App. We not be considered to have modified or waived any of our rights or remedies under this Terms of Use unless the modification or waiver is in writing and signed by our authorized representative. Email exchanges may not result in a waiver or modification of these Terms of Use. No delay or omission by us in exercising its rights or remedies will impair its rights or be construed as a waiver.  Any single or partial exercise of a right or remedy will not preclude further exercise of any other right or remedy.

You will not transfer, assign or delegate your rights or obligations under this Terms of Use to anyone without our express written permission, and any attempt to do so will be null and void. We may assign this Terms of Use in its sole discretion.

The App is controlled and operated from Italy. Those who access or use the App from other jurisdictions do so at their own volition and are entirely responsible for compliance with all applicable Italy and local laws and regulations. You warrant that you are not prohibited from receiving US origin products, including services or software. You may not use or access the App if you are a resident of a country embargoed by Italy, or are a foreign person or entity blocked or denied by Italian government.

Neither of the parties to this Terms of Use will be responsible for the failure to perform or any delay in performance of any obligation hereunder due to labor disturbances, accidents, fires, floods, telecommunications or Internet failures, strikes, wars, riots, rebellions, blockades, acts of government, governmental requirements and regulations or restrictions imposed by law or any other similar conditions beyond the reasonable control of such party. The time for performance of such party will be extended by the period of such delay.

Entire Agreement
If you are using the App on behalf of a legal entity, you represent that you are authorized to enter into an agreement on behalf of that legal entity. These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between you and us and governs your use of the App, superseding any prior agreements between you and us. You will not assign the Terms of Use or assign any rights or delegate any obligations hereunder, in whole or in part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without our prior written consent. Any purported assignment or delegation by you without our appropriate prior written consent will be null and void. We may assign these Terms of Use or any rights hereunder without your consent. If any provision of these Terms of Use is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or otherwise unenforceable, the parties nevertheless agree that such portion will be deemed severable from these Terms of Use and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions, and the remaining provisions of the Terms of Use remain in full force and effect. Neither the course of conduct between the parties nor trade practice will act to modify the Terms of Use. These Terms of Use do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights.

The paragraph headings in this Terms of Use are included for ease of reference only and have no binding effect. These Terms of Use and all documents referenced in this Terms of Use comprise the entire agreement between you and us with respect to the use of our App. If any provision of this Terms of Use is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision will not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Terms of Use, which will remain in full force and effect.
